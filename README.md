# flat-bin
Script that generates launchers for flatpaks in a bin folder, so they can be used with dmenu.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/AngelJumbo/flat-bin
cd flat-bin
sudo cp ./flat-bin /usr/local/bin/flat-bin

```

## Usage
By default the script generates the launchers in $HOME/.local/bin/ so that folder should be part of your PATH.

You should run this script every time that you install a flatpak app.
